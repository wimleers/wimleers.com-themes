# wimleers.com-themes

These are the custom [Drupal][1] 7 themes in use on <http://wimleers.com>.


## wimleers_v1

This is not *exactly* as it was on <http://wimleers.com> when it was on Drupal 5, but it is very close.

In Drupal 7, it now requires far less code thanks to Drupal's *subtheme* functionality. This is a subtheme of [Garland][2].


## wimleers_v2

The new <http://wimleers.com>, designed in 2011 & 2012 by the awesome [Xavier Bertels][3] (the first time I've hired a professional designer!). The logo was designed by the at least equally awesome [Ine Spee][4]. Both of them are from my hometown of Hasselt, Belgium :)
